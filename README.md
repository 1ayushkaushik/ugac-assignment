 • The Student Hub efficiently manages student information, including roll numbers, departments, and
 hostels, simplifying data management tasks.
 • I created a data table to showcase student information, including roll numbers, departments, and hostels.
 Integrated buttons within the table allow for easy database updates, improving data management
 efficiency.
 • The Databasing was done using PHP and XAMPP server.
